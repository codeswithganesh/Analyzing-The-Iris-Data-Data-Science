**Iris Dataset Classification**

**Overview**

This Python script performs classification on the famous Iris dataset using three different models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression. The script includes data loading, basic exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation.

**Prerequisites**

Ensure you have the following libraries installed before running the script:
pip install pandas scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The script generates a pair plot using seaborn to visualize relationships between different features in the Iris dataset. This plot helps in understanding the distribution and separability of classes.

**Model Training and Evaluation**

The script splits the dataset into training and testing sets, initializes three classification models, and evaluates their performance. The evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and a detailed classification report.

**Models Included**

Decision Tree
Random Forest
Logistic Regression

**Results**

The script prints the evaluation metrics for each model, providing insights into how well each model performs on the Iris dataset.
